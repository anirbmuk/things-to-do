:heavy_check_mark: **Lightweight UI**  
> Makes use of light UI components, so that your app remains featherlight and blazing fast!  

:heavy_check_mark: **Strong Search**  
> Searches your TODOs by text or heading or due-date tags. e.g. search by **`grocery`**, **`due tomorrow`**, **`next week`** etc.  
> You can also use arithmetic operators such as **`eq, >, <, >=, <=`**. For example, **'`eq 7`'** or **'`>= 5`'** or **'`< 3`'** to filter on the due date.  

:heavy_check_mark: **Dark Mode Support**  
> Turn on dark mode on your mobile/laptop/PC and the page looks as elegant as it can get.  

:heavy_check_mark: **Easy Share**  
> Share your TODO items on your favourite medium.  

:heavy_check_mark: **Built with Angular v15**  
> - All standalone components  
> - Typed reactive forms
